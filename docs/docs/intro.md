# Introduction
Analscript will help you write modern anal-driven code without taking a sweat.  
Written in JavaScript by @airscripts, it's a remake of the original AnalLang today lost in the meadows of npm and GitHub.  
You can read more about it on our [esolangs.org page](https://esolangs.org/wiki/analscript).

## Something Missing?
If you find issues with the documentation or have suggestions on how to improve the documentation or the project in general, please file an issue for us on GitHub.
